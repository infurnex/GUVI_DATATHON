## Introduction

In the real estate industry, accurate rent predictions play a crucial role in assisting property owners, tenants, and property management companies in making informed decisions. This project aims to develop a predictive model that estimates the rental price of residential properties using a dataset containing historical rental information and property attributes.

## Problem Statement

The main goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that accurately predicts the rental price of residential properties based on relevant features. The model is trained on the provided training dataset, `House_rent_train.csv`. The resulting model is saved as `rent_predictor.pkl` for future use.
